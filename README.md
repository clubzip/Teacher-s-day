# Teacher-s-day
Temporary repository for the Teacher's day Thank you campaign.

Hello, I’m a Korean student of CSE.
 You may know that there’s the Teacher’s day in Korea. It’s May 15, this Friday, so I mean how about expressing gratitude to professors by chatting on BB collaborate or zoom? As you know most of the classes are not on Friday, so I think it will be okay to do that at the beginning of classes on Wednesday and Thursday. (For the classes on Friday, it will be better to do this on Friday.)
It’s very easy! Just type “Thank you professor!(A thank-you note what you want) <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3” In the chat window.
Additionally, if you’re interested, how about setting your profile image with attached image? The red carnation is symbolic present of expressing respect in Korea. (Is it the same in your country?)
 For BB collaborate, you can set your profile in course room. Click setting button at the bottom right of screen. Then you can find the profile setting. For zoom, you can check the setting button at the top right of chatting room. Then you can find the profile setting and you can change your profile image by clicking your original profile image.
I have already proposed this to Korean students’ community, and most of them seems positive about this. Thus, you won’t be alone! (However, don’t forget that this is just a voluntary campaign. Nobody will blame you even if you don’t take part in this campaign.)
I think most of you may be getting suffered with the online lectures even more than the Korean students, because of the time difference. All I can say is cheer up.. I hope this campaign make your online lectures more enjoyable. Thank you and stay strong!
